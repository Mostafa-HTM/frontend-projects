## Features

-   **Semantic HTML Structure:** Utilizes meaningful HTML tags, including the `<time>` element for precise date representation and `<ul>`/`<li>` for logical timeline item organization, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
-   **Effective Flexbox Layout:** Employs CSS Flexbox to efficiently align and distribute content, providing a flexible and robust foundation for the timeline structure.
-   **Precise CSS Positioning:** Demonstrates the application of `position: relative` on parent elements and `position: absolute` on pseudo-elements (`::before`) to create accurate and visually distinct timeline markers and lines.
-   **Smooth CSS Animations:** Integrates `@keyframes` animations with `animation-delay` and `nth-child` pseudo-classes to achieve a subtle, staggered fade-in effect for each timeline item upon page load.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal display and usability across a wide range of devices and screen resolutions through the strategic use of `@media` queries.
-   **Clean and Organized Codebase:** Follows best practices for HTML and CSS structuring, making the component easy to understand and maintain.
